## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During the development of the contact form project, I managed to learn a few things:

Form assembly and validation: Since it was my first time building a form, I had to figure out to use these new elements in a valid and structured way. I also learned how to implement a bit of client-side form validation using JavaScript. This included checking for required fields, validating email formats, and ensuring that users select a query type. This experience reinforced the importance of providing immediate feedback to users to enhance their experience.


### Continued development

I would like to keep exploring the possibilities of JavaScript and CSS to improve the user experience and accessibility of the contact form. Doing it all from scratch was a great learning experience, but I'm sure there are many ways to improve it, since I left some objectives unfulfilled, such as the use of custom radio buttons and checkmarks.

### Useful resources
